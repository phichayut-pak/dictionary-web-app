## Overview

This is a solution to the [Dictionary Web App on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/dictionary-web-app-h5wwnyuKFL) 

This challenge is to build a fully responsive dictionary web app using an API for word definitions and other functionalities such as searching for words, viewing definitions, and toggling between light and dark themes. The project is an excellent practice for me to catch up after I haven't touched a code for a period.
## Tech Stack
- NextJS - to build a component-based website
- TailwindCSS - to style up the page with an ease
- DaisyUI - to use the styled components in order to lessen the time in styling
## Challenge
The only issue that I found was when I was doing the change in fonts on the navbar. At first, it did not change after I clicked to change the font. After I did searching and debugging, I suddenly found out that this can be fixed in tailwind config which is to load the fonts at the first place.
## What could be improved

In overall, I think this already meets the expectations of the practice that I think it should be. I might add some animations or transitions for the page to be smoother. The site might also not be pixel perfect or not be exactly as same as the design yet, so this could be improved. I also took too much time in this project which I could have done it faster.
